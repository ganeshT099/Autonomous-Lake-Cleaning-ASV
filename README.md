Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) designed for systematic lake cleaning using structured coverage planning, real-time navigation, and safety monitoring.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a modular ROS 2 based navigation stack for an Autonomous Lake Cleaning Surface Vehicle (ALCSV).

The system includes:

- Coverage Planning (Zig-Zag within Geofence)
- Geofencing Safety System
- Waypoint-based Navigation
- Real-time Visualization in RViz
- Modular ROS 2 Architecture

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

### Mission Layer
Handles system startup, monitoring, and mission control.

### Coverage Planning Layer
Generates structured zig-zag coverage path within a defined geofence boundary.

### Navigation & Control Layer
Executes waypoint tracking and heading control.

### Safety Layer
Monitors geofence violations and emergency conditions.
